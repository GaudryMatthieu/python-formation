# Python formation

To start this training, I suggest you follow the following commands

Create a virtual environnement for the dependancies

``` bash
python -m venv venv 
```

Activate it 

``` bash
\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependancies from the requirement file

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
